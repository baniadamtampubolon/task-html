            With optional Porsche Entry & Drive, you can leave your car key in your pocket. As soon as you grab the door handle, or your hand nears the Crest on the front luggage compartment lid or the logos on the rear, Porsche Entry & Drive checks the access code stored in the key. If this is correct, the door or luggage compartment lid unlocks. The engine can then be started and switched off using the electronic ignition starter switch.
            ¹ The Porsche Entry & Drive system uses state-of-the-art technology. However, it cannot be completely ruled out that the key’s wireless encryption code is intercepted and used to open or steal the vehicle.

            The optional GT sports steering wheel has a smaller diameter. The spokes are finished in Black, the Silver-coloured inlays are screw-fastened. For a motor sports derived look? Definitely. Above all, though, to emulate a motor sports driving feel. Included as standard in the 718 GTS 4.0 models. And covered with the motor sports proven Race-Tex. Available as an option on all steering wheels and standard on 718 Style Edition models: heated steering wheel and multi-function. These give you convenient access to the 4.6-inch colour display, the on-board computer and many audio, phone and navigation functions.

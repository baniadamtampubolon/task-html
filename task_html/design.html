        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>
            Precise, not fanciful. Self-assured, not restrained. Low, wide and sleek. The exterior design of the 718 models is distinguished by sporty edges and clearly defined formal contours.

        <h2>
            At first glance: sporty. At second glance: blown away.        
        </h2>
        <p>
            Striking design: the unmistakable silhouette with the flyline typical of a mid-mounted engine. A broad rear with black accent trim. The cockpit is fully sports-orientated.

            Exterior Front       
        </h2>
        <p>
            The horizontal geometry of the air intakes makes the front end appear even wider – lending it added bite. On the 718 GTS 4.0 models, this impression is further enhanced by the larger air intakes, black external airblades and front spoiler in black. The wings? Unmistakably Porsche. Higher than the bonnet, they have been styled to give prominence to the design of the headlights, with impressive inner workings and integrated LED daytime running lights. The 718 GTS 4.0 models have tinted front lights.

        <h2>
            Side air intake
        </h2>
        <p>
            The side profile emphasises the mid-engine layout. The wheel openings are large – for wheels up to 20 inches. This highlights the fact that the 718 models are not built for the garage. But for unrestrained driving pleasure. It is only logical that the lines on the doors direct the airflow into the large side air intakes. To optimally supply the engines with air and produce powerful thrust.

        <h2>
            Rear exterior
        </h2>
        <p>
            The rear of the 718 models is an expression of maximum sporting performance – and also the top performance of our designers. It is clear, reduced, and anything but conformist. The taillights are flat and also tinted in the 718 GTS 4.0 models. Their interior is of a three-dimensional design. Four LED brake spot lights surround the horizontal taillights. An accent trim between the two taillights makes the rear end look wide.
            The wing above automatically extends from speeds of 125 km/h, and reduces lift for better traction. Powerful reinforcement: the tailpipe, centrally arranged in the rear apron, which is designed as a twin tailpipe in the 718 Style Edition and 718 S models. In the 718 GTS 4.0 models, the tailpipes are separated in the rear apron unique to the GTS 4.0.        </p>

            Interior design
        </h2>
        <p>
            Intuitive handling, performance-oriented ergonomics, a clean design. The interior of the 718 models is also fully geared towards sporty performance.
